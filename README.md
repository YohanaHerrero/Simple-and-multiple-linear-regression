Use simple and multiple linear regression to predict new continuos data points according to a training set.

The table FuelConsumption.csv contains car characteristics (independent variable) and its corresponding CO2 emission (dependent variable).

With simple and multiple linear regression, I will train the model on a training dataset and I will then predict CO2 emissions for various car characteristics using a test dataset. 
Finally, I assess the model accuracy.
